## How we built it.

We built Petsz using NextJS for our front end and we have multiple AI tools powered by llama index, vectara and fireworks.ai

## Challenges we ran into

Many of the existing AI tools did not have provisions for Image embeddings

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our post moderation powered by Fireworks.ai and ai pet guide chatbot is functional

## What we learned

Tools such as Fireworks.ai, llamaindex and vectara can be incorporated intro products that we built

## What's next for Petsz

We hope to include a playdate matching option as suggestions for users who post similar pets by comparing image embeddings
